- **Project Summary**: 
  - [Summarize the Background/Motivation]
  - **Project Summary**
  - In the trust game, player A and player B have the choices of "Trust" or "Betray", and they get different results of payoff accordingly. Nash Equilibrium can be achieved when both of players adopt strategies that maximize their own expected interest. However, in the real-world practice, players tend to consider more external factors, especially the risk in trading-off. Thus, Nash Equilibrium is not a comprehensive way to analyze the outcome and potential strategies of players. This project will further analyze the behaviors of players with the sense of risk aversion in the trust game.
  - **Background and Motivations**
  - There have been studies examining the factors that influence individuals' decision-making in trust/investment games, including gender, cultural and age factors (Buchan et al., 1999, 2008; Cox & Deck, 2006, etc.). Also, several studies (Anderhub et al., 2002; Dickhaut et al., 2008, etc.) have focused on how game behavior changes with increasing repetitions. Furthermore, there is substantial research questioning the interpretation of "trust." Cox (2004) suggests that individuals may act with pure altruism, simply intending to benefit others, regardless of whether the other party reciprocates. Ben-Ner and Putterman (2001), on the other hand, argue that the willingness to trust is at least partly linked to a willingness to take risks. Is the investment decision in trust/investment games, which are designed with anonymous one-shot interactions, equivalent to taking a risky gamble (Eckel & Wilson, 2004)? Bohnet and Zeckhauser (2004) found that trust in others is not only influenced by factors such as risk, consideration for others, and efficiency preferences, but also takes into account the costs of betrayal that go beyond monetary losses.
  - [Research Questions]
  - **Why is it important to consider the influence of RISK on players’ behaviors or strategies in the trust game?**
RISK reflects the inherent uncertainty and potential consequences that individuals may face when making decisions in real-life situations. It’s significant because it impact individual’s decision-making strategies because people usually have different risk attitudes. They may adjust their behaviors based on their perception of risk in the trust game. 
  - **What’s  the different between the new solution concept and Nash Equilibrium?**
The new solution concept, which considers risk, goes beyond the traditional Nash Equilibrium. While Nash Equilibrium focuses on the stability of strategies when no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate, the new solution concept incorporates risk and analyzes how risk preferences shape players' behaviors and strategies. It considers strategies that maximize expected utility or expected payoff, taking into account players' risk attitudes. 
  - **How does RISK work in the trust game?**
Individuals with different risk attitudes keep varying levels of willingness to trust or invest. Risk-averse players might be more cautious and hesitant to take risks, leading to lower levels of trust or investment. On the other hand, risk-seeking players may be more inclined to take higher risks and exhibit more trusting or investing behaviors.
Players may assess the potential risks associated with trusting or investing, considering the reliability and past experiences. Players may adjust the level of trust or investment accordingly.
Players may use risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses or maximize potential gains, such as diversifying investments, setting limits on trust or investment amounts, and adjusting behaviors based on the perceived risk-reward trade-off.

  - [Application Scenario]
  - **Game Environment**
  - The game involves two players facing an investment and payoff problem, with A making investment decisions and generating profits or losses, and B making decisions regarding the allocation of the payoff.
The two anonymous collaborators are situated within an investment environment, where one person, acting as the sender, possesses a certain amount of funds and must decide how much money to invest. The investment amount generates profits or losses according to certain rules, and it is the responder, the other person in the interaction, who decides how to allocate the resulting gains or losses between the sender and responder. 
Through this process, the sender's final reward is the remaining amount after deducting the investment amount from the initial funds, plus the portion allocated by the responder from the investment outcome. The responder's final reward is the portion of the investment outcome allocated to themselves. This game delineates a scenario where returns are contingent on investment and involves the element of risk.
